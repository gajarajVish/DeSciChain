ðŸ”„ WALLET CONNECTION FIXES APPLIED - CACHE CLEAR REQUIRED

To see the updated wallet connection fixes, please:

1. ðŸ”„ HARD REFRESH your browser:
   - Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Firefox: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Safari: Cmd+Option+R (Mac)

2. ðŸ§¹ OR Clear browser cache:
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Right-click refresh button â†’ "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

3. âœ… Look for this message in console:
   "ðŸ†• UPDATED BLOCKCHAIN SERVICE - Version 2.0"

ðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER CACHE CLEAR:
- Should detect 3 wallets (including Demo Wallet)
- AlgoSigner should try multiple ledgers automatically
- Demo Wallet should be available as fallback
- More detailed connection logging

If you still see the old behavior, the cache hasn't cleared properly.
